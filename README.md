# Ahmed — Flutter Developer

Flutter • Clean Architecture • MVVM • Riverpod • Android & iOS

I enjoy building mobile applications that stay maintainable as they grow — not just apps that work today, but ones that are still understandable months later.

Most of my work focuses on structured Flutter development, combining clean architecture principles with practical state management and real-world integrations.

## About Me

I'm a Flutter developer who cares about how applications are designed behind the UI.

I enjoy working on problems involving architecture, async behavior, SDK integrations, and platform communication between Flutter and native mobile systems.

Recently, I’ve been building production-oriented applications that required deeper work with Android internals and preparing the same infrastructure to scale cleanly toward iOS.

## How I Build Apps

My development approach usually follows:

- Clean Architecture + MVVM separation
- Feature-first project organization
- Predictable state management using Riverpod
- Clear responsibility between layers
- Writing code that future-me (and teammates) can understand

I prefer stability and clarity over unnecessary complexity.
