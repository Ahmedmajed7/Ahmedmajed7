# Ahmed — Flutter Developer

Flutter • Clean Architecture • MVVM • Riverpod • Android & iOS

Most of the work here revolves around building Flutter applications with strong structure and long-term maintainability in mind.

The intention behind the work here is simple — build applications that remain clear, scalable, and stable as they grow beyond the initial version.

## How Projects Are Usually Built Here

Most repositories follow a consistent approach:

- Clean Architecture combined with MVVM
- Feature-first project organization
- Riverpod for predictable state management
- Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers

The focus is always on keeping projects understandable and easy to extend over time.

## The Kind of Problems I Enjoy Working On

Many of these projects involve situations where architecture decisions matter just as much as implementation.

That often includes:
- structuring applications from the ground up
- working through complex SDK integrations
- connecting Flutter with native Android when required
- improving reliability when apps move closer to production use

A lot of practical learning came from solving issues that required digging deeper than documentation and understanding how systems behave internally.

## What You'll Find Here

### Flutter Applications
Apps built around scalable architecture, async workflows, and real application behavior rather than UI-only examples.

### Platform Integration
Work involving MethodChannels, Android SDK integrations, and preparing Flutter infrastructure to transition smoothly toward iOS support.

### Experiments & Learning
Smaller projects used to explore architecture patterns, performance ideas, and development improvements.
