# Ahmed — Flutter Developer

Flutter • Mobile Applications • Android & iOS

This profile reflects the applications and systems built while working with Flutter across both mobile development and platform-level integrations.

The focus throughout these projects is simple: build applications that work reliably, scale comfortably, and remain easy to understand as they grow.

## What I Work On

Most projects here involve more than UI development.  
They include structuring applications, managing state and data flow, integrating external services, and working directly with native mobile layers when Flutter alone isn’t enough.

Typical areas of work include:
- building complete Flutter application flows
- state management and business logic design
- backend and API integration
- asynchronous operations and real device interaction
- Flutter and native Android communication

## Selected Work

### Smart Home Mobile Application

Development of a smart home application focused on device onboarding and home automation control.

This project required working beyond the Flutter layer and integrating a native Android IoT SDK to support real device activation and management flows.

Work involved:
- Flutter ↔ Android communication using MethodChannels
- Native SDK integration and configuration
- QR-based device pairing and activation
- Handling Android activities and SDK routing
- Managing complex async device processes
- Preparing the architecture for cross-platform expansion to iOS
